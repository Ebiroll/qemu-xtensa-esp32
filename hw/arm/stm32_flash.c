/*
 * STM32 Microcontroller Flash Memory
 * The STM32 family stores its Flash memory at some base address in memory
 * (0x08000000 for medium density devices), and then aliases it to the
 * boot memory space, which starts at 0x00000000 (the System Memory can also
 * be aliased to 0x00000000, but this is not implemented here).  The processor
 * executes the code in the aliased memory at 0x00000000, but we need to
 * implement the "real" flash memory as well.  This "real" flash memory will
 * pass reads through to the memory at 0x00000000, which is where QEMU loads
 * the executable image.  Note that this is opposite of real hardware, where the
 * memory at 0x00000000 passes reads through the "real" flash memory, but it
 * works the same either way.
